/**
 * This class manages the internal `default fields` for logging classes, with a
 * notion of parent/child relationships and hierarchy.
 * A Child element will inherit the fields from the Parent element, and
 * complete (or even override part of it) with its own fields. For instance,
 * a child can redefine (and thus override in the final result) a field that is
 * already defined by its parent.
 *
 * This class shall be used embedded within loggers, to provide the `Default
 * fields` and hierarchy logics.
 *
 * @private @property {DefaultFields} parent     - The parent node in the
 *                                                 hierarchy
 * @private @property {DefaultFields[]} children - The list of children nodes
 *                                                 in the hierarchy
 * @private @property {Object} fields            - The dictionary of fields
 *                                                 defined for this node
 * @private @property {Object} parentFields      - The dictionary of fields
 *                                                 inherited by this node from
 *                                                 its parent node
 * @private @property {Object} precomputedFields - The prepared dictionary of
 *                                                 aggregated fields containing
 *                                                 the parent's fields
 *                                                 overriden with the node's
 *                                                 own fields. This is used as
 *                                                 a trick to reduce the
 *                                                 computational need.
